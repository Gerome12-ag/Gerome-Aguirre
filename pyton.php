				<h1>What are Computer Programming Languages?</h1>
				<p>Computer programming language allows us to give instructions to a computer in the language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a "binary." Translating programming languages into binary is commonalities between programming languages.<br><br>These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.<br><br>There are dozen of programming languages used in the industry today. We've compiled overviews of the 12 most important, relevant and in-demand of these languages below.
