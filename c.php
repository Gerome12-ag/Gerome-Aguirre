				<h1>What are Computer Programming Languages?</h1>
				<p>Computer programming language allows us to give instructions to a computer in the language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a "binary." Translating programming languages into binary is commonalities between programming languages.<br><br>These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.<br><br>There are dozen of programming languages used in the industry today. We've compiled overviews of the 12 most important, relevant and in-demand of these languages below.

			<h3 style="color: yellow;">WHAT MAKES LEARNING IT IMPORTANT?</h3>
			<p style="color: white;">C Language is used to develop systems applications that are integrated into operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux, as well as embedded softwares. Applications include graphics packages, word processors, spreadsheets, operating system development, database systems, compilers and assemblers, network drivers and interpreters.</p>
				<ul>
					<li style="color: orange;"> Facebookâ€™s TAO systems is programmed mostly using C language.</li>
					<li style="color: orange;"> Most device drivers are still developed using C Language.</li>
					<li style="color: orange;">Features:</li>
						<ul>
							<li style="color: white;"> Simple to learn; there are only 32 keywords to master</li>
							<li style="color: white;"> Easy to write systems programs such as compilers and interpreters</li>
							<li style="color: white;"> Foundational language for beginners</li>
						</ul>

			<h3 style="color: yellow;">WHERE DID IT START?</h3>
			<p style="color: white;">The C Language was developed in 1972 at Bell Labs specifically for implementing the UNIX system. It eventually gave rise to many advanced programming languages, including C++, Java C#, JavaScript and Pearl.</p>
