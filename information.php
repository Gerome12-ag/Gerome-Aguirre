			<h1 style="color:; font-size: 35px; text-indent: 10px; background:linear-gradient(to left, red,white,red); border:1px solid white; width: 50%;">Why Study Information Technology?</h1>
			<p>Modern organizations rely on highly complex information systems to deliver products and services. Designing, developing and managing such systems are tasks that require both solid knowledge of key information technologies and a deep understanding of people, organizations and businesses.</p>

			<p>The IT industry is in great demand for professionals who possess this skill combination. According to a 2014 study by Statistics Canada, in Canada only, the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) sector amounts to $169.8 Billion in revenues per year, employing more than half a million people predominantly in the Software and Computer Service sector. Employment in ICT grows twice as fast as the overall economy. According to another study by the Information and Communication Technologies Council (ICTC), 182,000 new IT professionals will be needed in Canada by 2019, with roles such as information systems analysts and consultants and computer and information systems managers being the most in-demand: in Ontario alone, more than 40,000 such positions will need to be filled by 2019, which is more than half of all other ICT position types.</p>

			<p>And they seem to pay well! The average salary in ICT is 47% than the economy-wide average, Software and Computer Service sector being the best paid, according to the Statistics Canada report. Indeed, according to Glassdoor, roles such as Software Development Manager, IT Manager and Solution Architect are amongst the top 10 highest paying jobs in demand in America (together with, e.g. , Physicians and Lawyers). For the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, computer and information systems managers are also among the 20 highest paying occupations. These are people who "plan, coordinate and direct computer-related activities in an organization".</p>

			<p>In the School of ITEC, we focus on knowledge and skills that fit exactly these requirements. Solid application and web programming courses are combined with courses such as Systems Analysis, Project Management, Business Intelligence and Business Process Management Systems aiming at educating versatile IT Professionals. </p>

			<p >In this modern day and age, information technology plays a big role. However, if you’re not in the field of information technology yourself, you might not know just how information technology touches your life. Read below to find out how information technology plays a role in a number of different fields that you might not have realized.</p>

			<p>For those of you that don’t know, information technology is the study and use of systems for storing, retrieving, and sending information. This can include software, hardware, applications, and so much more. Much of what people use in the 21st century was created with help from information technology.</p>

			<p>Items as common as cars use information technology. Business, education, and even healthcare have all been redesigned thanks to information technology. Read more about how each field has been changed using information technology below.</p>

			<h1 style="font-size: 30px; width: 63%; text-align: center; border:1px solid black; background-image: linear-gradient(to left, yellow,white,yellow);">The Importance of Information Technology in Business</h1>
			<p>With the introduction of computers, the business world was changed forever. Using computers and software, businesses use information technology to ensure that their departments run smoothly. They use information technology in a number of different departments including human resources, finance, manufacturing, and security.</p>
			<p>Using information technology, businesses have the ability to view changes in the global markets far faster than they usually do. They purchase software packages and hardware that helps them get their job done. Most larger businesses have their own information technology department designed to upkeep the software and hardware. </p>
			<p>Information technology has allowed businesses to keep up with the supply and demand as consumers grow more anxious to have their items instantly. Using information technology, businesses like Amazon are working to help busy consumers do their grocery shopping. Just a few clicks on a website allows the consumer to submit an order, and information technology sends that order to the company.</p>

			<h1 style="font-size: 30px; width: 63%; text-align: center; border:1px solid black; background-image: linear-gradient(to left, yellow,white,yellow);">The Importance of Information Technology in Education</h1>
			<p>The world of education is changing as the modern world continues to grow. With so much progress happening, it’s important that education be able to reach students in new ways so that their students are prepared for the future. The students of today are the leaders, inventors, teachers, and businessmen (and women) of tomorrow. Without the proper skills, these students will not have the preparation needed to survive.</p>
			<p>With so much focus placed on education, it can sometimes be difficult to hold a job and still get the training needed to get a better job. Information technology plays a key role in students being able to keep their jobs and go to school. Now, most schools offer online classes that can be accessed on computers or laptops, tablets, and even mobile phones. A busy student at work can easily check in or submit assignments while on their lunch break.</p>

			<h1 style="font-size: 30px; width: 63%; text-align: center; border:1px solid black; background-image: linear-gradient(to left, yellow,white,yellow);">The Importance of Information Technology in Finance</h1>
			<p>With all the online purchases going on, it’s important that banks and security keep tabs on everything to keep everyone safe. Information technology might just working its hardest with internet transactions. As more transactions are done, the internet requires more networks, more computers, and more security programs to keep its consumers safe. Without information technology, these purchases would be impossible, and it would be impossible for banks to keep these purchases secure.</p>
			<p>Information technology has also made it faster and easier than ever to send or receive money. It’s now also easier to open an online small business to sell whatever you might want. If you don’t want to have to file for a domain name, set up a website, and all the other steps required for registering an online business, you can use other websites like Amazon, eBay, and Etsy to sell things.</p>
			<p>Information technology also makes it easy for finance to function on a global level. In this modern age, your credit score and credit rating is available online securely. This allows lenders, insurance companies, and businesses to run a quick credit check on you making it far easier to open credit.</p>

			<h1 style="font-size: 30px; width: 63%; text-align: center; border:1px solid black; background-image: linear-gradient(to left, yellow,white,yellow);">The Importance of Information Technology in Healthcare</h1>
			<p>Improvements in information technology have allowed for great reform in healthcare. Most medical offices can now send and receive digital medical information from doctors you’ve had in the past. Changes like this allow costs to be lowered and increase the amount of time doctors can spend on patients compared to paperwork.</p>
			<p>Security improvements with information technology have made it so that your medical information is secure no matter where it’s sent. You can even have prescriptions sent digitally to local pharmacies at most medical offices. </p>

			<h1 style="font-size: 30px; width: 63%; text-align: center; border:1px solid black; background-image: linear-gradient(to left, yellow,white,yellow);">The Importance of Information Technology in Security</h1>
			<p>With so many transactions done online and so much information available online, it’s important to keep all of that safe. Information technology makes it possible for your online data to stay secure until accessed by the proper channels. Using passwords and encryption, information technology hides your personal digital data away, and the only way it can be accessed is by companies who have permission from you.</p>
