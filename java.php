				<h1>What are Computer Programming Languages?</h1>
				<p>Computer programming language allows us to give instructions to a computer in the language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a "binary." Translating programming languages into binary is commonalities between programming languages.<br><br>These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.<br><br>There are dozen of programming languages used in the industry today. We've compiled overviews of the 12 most important, relevant and in-demand of these languages below.

			<h3 style="color: yellow;">WHAT MAKES LEARNING IT IMPORTANT?</h3>
			<p style="color: white;">Java is used to develop enterprise-level applications for video games and mobile apps, as well as to create web-baseed applications with JSP (Java Server Pages). When used online, Java allows applets to be download and used through a browser, which can then perform a function not normally available.</p>
				<ul>
					<li style="color: orange;">Programs that use or are written in Java include Adobe Creative Suite, Eclipse, LOtus Notes, Minecraft and OpenOffice.</li>
					<li style="color: orange;">Java is the core foundation for developing Android apps.</li>
					<li style="color: orange;">Features:</li>
						<ul>
							<li style="color: white;">Application portability</li>
							<li style="color: white;">Robust and interpreted language</li>
							<li style="color: white;">Extensive network library</li>
